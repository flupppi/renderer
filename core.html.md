## Build

Switch to the `source` folder of the project.

create a folder to store the build in,
e.g.Â `mkdir cmake-build-debug-visual-studio` and navigate to it. From
there run cmake to configura the project and generate a native build
system.

`cd cmake-build-debug-visual-studio`

`cmake ..`

Then we can call the build system again from the source folder to
compile and link the project.

`cmake --build .\cmake-build-debug-visual-studio\ --target CXXOpenGL`

This creates a `CXXOpenGL.exe` that we can run using its different
command line parameters.

Simply run
`.\cmake-build-debug-visual-studio\Debug\CXXOpenGL.exe --help` to print
the different options available.

    A simple engine with glTF viewer
    Usage:
      Engine [OPTION...]

      -p, --program arg  Program mode (Application, BillboardCloud, etc.)
                         (default: Application)
      -m, --path arg     Path to glTF model file
      -h, --help         Print usage information

The different program options available at the moment are: \*
Application \* BillboardCloud

Each of these will get a detailed explanation in the following sections.

## Raytracer

Currently, the simplest call to start the program is
`.\cmake-build-debug-visual-studio\Debug\CXXOpenGL.exe -p Raytracer -m ""`
